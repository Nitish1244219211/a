## Performance Considerations

- Optimized CSS animations using `transform` and `opacity`
- Minimal DOM manipulation for better performance
- Efficient event listeners with proper cleanup
- Responsive images and scalable vector graphics

## Customization

### Modifying Tips
Edit the `tips` array in `script.js`:
```javascript
const tips = [
    "Your custom tip here",
    "Another helpful tip",
    // Add more tips as needed
];
```

### Adjusting Timing
Modify timing constants in `script.js`:
```javascript
// Credit screen duration (default: 3000ms)
setTimeout(() => {
    showLoadingScreen();
}, 3000);

// Tip rotation interval (default: 5000ms)
tipInterval = setInterval(updateTip, 5000);
```

### Styling Changes
Key CSS variables for easy customization:
- Colors: Modify the CSS color values in `styles.css`
- Fonts: Change the Google Fonts imports in `index.html`
- Animations: Adjust keyframe animations and durations

## Known Issues

- Audio may require user interaction on some browsers due to autoplay policies
- Orientation detection may have slight delays on some devices
- Web Audio API not supported in older browsers (graceful fallback included)

## Future Enhancements
